ASSIGNMENT 1:
What are the differences file-wise?
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
spec:
    matchLabels:

Identify what commands can be run after "kubectl apply -f kubia-replicaset.yaml"
Make a service over these pods (kubia-replicaset) and see if the service picks up the web-service within the pod ("You have hit....." message)
Ans: You've hit kubia-tgdw8.
Negative Testing : change the labels of the pod and see if the service is still applied on those pods
Ans: You've hit kubia-tgdw8 

ASSIGNMENT 2
go to cronjob.yaml (/root/kubernetes-training/04-controllers)
[root@ip-172-31-29-185 04-controllers]# kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml
cronjob.batch/batch-job-every-fifteen-minutes created

Find out what is the command to "get" the running jobs.
crontab -l

Observe and if possible, paste the results from your practicals.
[root@ip-172-31-29-185 04-controllers]# crontab -l
no crontab for root

Also identify how you would "permanently arrest" the jobs from running.
service crond stop

What is the change from normal Jobs (jobs v/s cronJobs) - Your observation in one sentence.
Jobs use completion and parallelism parameters to control the patterns. 
Job pods can run as a single task, several sequential tasks.
the first task that finishes instructs the rest of the to complete.
CronJobs are useful for creating periodic and recurring tasks, like running backups or sending emails.
CronJobs can also schedule individual tasks for a specific time, such as scheduling a Job for when your cluster is likely to be idle.
